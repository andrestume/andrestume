## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is AndrÃ©s Tume, from Peru, and this is my personal repository.

I'm starting in this data world and I'm planning to be really good at it. Today, Decemeber 8th, 2024, I'm making my frist steps into GitHub.

A little bit about me:

I studied Accounting and work on a services firm for over two years, as a financial auditor. After that, change my career into sales as a Key Account Manager in another services company.

Then, Covid happened and various changes in my life as well. After some change directions, I ended up into a SaaS company for restaurants and gastronomic organizations (bars, foodtrucks, fast food chains). First, as a KAM. Later, as a Customer Success Manager, exploring, learning and diving deep into the client satisfaction, making memorable their experience with us.

Even though my work made me use data (in some cases a lot of it) to make data-driven decisions, it was never enough and my duties were always oriented into another direction besides full time data ones. So I always had the feeling to make, once more (and looking to be the last one), a change in my career, this time to a 100 % data oriented (and all the things this might include). So here I am, starting my data career, using GitHub as a diary and, of course, repository, through my steps into this amzing world.

Considering I already have experience using Excel, I decided to start a data bootcamp. First, SQL, which I'been learning for a few weeks now. After that, planning to continue to Python and Power BI, practicing as much as I can to master these tools and starting to look for some ideas to start a project, to make some mistakes and get better.

You might find things that could happen to me during my learning or some questions/ideas for those people that are curious and would like to help.

If someone has some ideas to help me improve into my career, I'm open to listen/read. I love sports, specially basketball, so it would be awesome to work on some data about it. And if you want to reach me out, here is my LinkedIn profile. We can connect over there and keep in touch: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-tume/
